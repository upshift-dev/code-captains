A codebase management tool for engineering teams.

<h3>What's included</h3>

-   Replacement for CODEOWNERS that's more configurable.
-   Github actions to enforce codebase rules.
-   Migration tool to convert CODEOWNERS to Upshift.
-   (soon) Integration into more tools like Jira, Linear, PagerDuty, Slack.

<h3>Why did we build this</h3>

As engineering leads, we've seen how eng teams can get bogged down once they have >8 people trying to work in the same repo.

We've also seen a growing trend of using monorepos and recoiling from microservice architectures.

We believe that eng teams need better codebase management tooling for these more modern approaches to collaborating on building awesome software.
